# BCI
A project about BCI data processing.  
More specifically, This is a dumb, useless, deadline-driven homework for my course, 
which is written by a rookie(me).

Dataset can be downloaded [there](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/desc_IVa.html)  
It includes some simple signal processing unit like filter, fft and slice. It uses SVM to predict the motion by the BCI data, and the result is pretty bad.   
The folder itself is also a git repo.
